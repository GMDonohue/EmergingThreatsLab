# EmergingThreatsLab
This project focuses on developing an API for a community-driven website dedicated to archiving and analyzing smishing (SMS phishing) messages. With the increasing prevalence of phishing attacks, the platform provides a centralized system where users can report fraudulent messages by submitting screenshots through a web interface.
The API processes these submissions using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract key details, including the message body, sender information, and any embedded links. Once extracted, this data is stored and analyzed to gather additional insights, such as potential malware associations, domain history, and metadata related to the sender or linked websites. To enhance security research, the system also captures landing page screenshots of phishing links, allowing users to inspect fraudulent sites without direct interaction.
Beyond archiving, the platform serves as a tool for cybersecurity awareness and research. By compiling a database of smishing attempts, it enables trend analysis, helps detect emerging phishing techniques, and supports integration with security tools. The API is designed for easy access, making it valuable for developers, researchers, and law enforcement agencies working to mitigate digital fraud.
This project aims to contribute to the fight against smishing by providing a structured, automated approach to reporting, analyzing, and understanding phishing attacks.
